// 1213. Intersection of Three Sorted Arrays
// 11/22/2020

// Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.



// Example 1:

// Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
// Output: [1,5]
// Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.

var arraysIntersection = function(arr1, arr2, arr3) {
  //create a results var set to an empty array
  //create a obj variable set to an empty object

  //iterate over the arrays at arr1.length as the comparison
    //if value at arr1 or arr2 or arr3
      //set obj at the value to 1
    //else
      //increment the value in the obj

  //iterate over the obj variable
    //if the value is equal to three
      //push the value into the result variable

  //return the result variable

};
